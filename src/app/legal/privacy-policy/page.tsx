                      <p>The new European Union (EU) data protection law, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), comes into effect on 25th May 2018.

In other words these new regulations allow you to have more control over your data. Weâ€™ve changed our Privacy Policy to reflect the new requirements of the GDPR.</p>
